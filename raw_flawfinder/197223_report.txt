Examining extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_197223_255574/njs_module_vuln.c

FINAL RESULTS:

njs_module.c:42:  [3] (buffer) realpath:This function does not protect against buffer overflows, and some implementations can overflow internally (CWE-120/CWE-785!).  Ensure that the destination buffer is at least of size MAXPATHLEN, andto protect against implementation problems, the input argument should also be checked to ensure it is no larger than MAXPATHLEN. 
njs_module.c:6:  [2] (buffer) char:Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120).  Perform bounds checking, use functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the maximum possible length. 
njs_module.c:47:  [2] (misc) open:Check when opening files - can an attacker redirect it (via symlinks), force the opening of special file type (e.g., device files), move things around to create a race condition, control its ancestors, or change its contents? (CWE-362).

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
 flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.
