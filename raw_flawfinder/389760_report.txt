Examining extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_206946_389760/jasper_fixed.c

FINAL RESULTS:

jasper.c:107:  [2] (integer) atoi:Unless checked, the resulting number can exceed the expected range (CWE-190).  If source untrusted, check both minimum and maximum, even if the input had no minus sign (large numbers can roll over into negative number; consider saving to an unsigned value if that is intended).

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
 flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
