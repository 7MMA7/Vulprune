main.c:11:  [4] (format) vsnprintf:If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited, and note that sprintf variations do not always \0-terminate (CWE-134).  Use a constant for the format specification. 
main.c:7:  [2] (buffer) char:Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120).  Perform bounds checking, use functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the maximum possible length. 
Minimum risk level = 1
