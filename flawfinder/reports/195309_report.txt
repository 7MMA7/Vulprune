gopher.cc:86:  [2] (buffer) memcpy:Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).  Make sure destination can always hold the source data.

gopher.cc:97:  [2] (buffer) memcpy:Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).  Make sure destination can always hold the source data. 
gopher.cc:279:  [2] (integer) atoi:Unless checked, the resulting number can exceed the expected range (CWE-190).  If source untrusted, check both minimum and maximum, even if the input had no minus sign (large numbers can roll over into negative number; consider saving to an unsigned value if that is intended). 
gopher.cc:281:  [2] (integer) atoi:Unless checked, the resulting number can exceed the expected range (CWE-190).  If source untrusted, check both minimum and maximum, even if the input had no minus sign (large numbers can roll over into negative number; consider saving to an unsigned value if that is intended).

gopher.cc:227:  [1] (buffer) strlen:Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).
