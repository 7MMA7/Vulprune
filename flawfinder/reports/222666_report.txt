tmate-main.c:5:  [3] (buffer) getopt:Some older implementations do not protect against internal buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20).  Check implementation on installation, or limit the size of all string inputs. 
tmate-main.c:17:  [2] (integer) atoi:Unless checked, the resulting number can exceed the expected range (CWE-190).  If source untrusted, check both minimum and maximum, even if the input had no minus sign (large numbers can roll over into negative number; consider saving to an unsigned value if that is intended). 
tmate-main.c:20:  [2] (integer) atoi:Unless checked, the resulting number can exceed the expected range (CWE-190).  If source untrusted, check both minimum and maximum, even if the input had no minus sign (large numbers can roll over into negative number; consider saving to an unsigned value if that is intended).
