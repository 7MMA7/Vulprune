inbound.c:4:  [2] (buffer) char:Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120).  Perform bounds checking, use functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the maximum possible length. 
inbound.c:17:  [2] (buffer) strcpy:Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned] (CWE-120).  Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy easily misused). Risk is low because the source is a constant string.
inbound.c:25:  [2] (buffer) strcat:Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination [MS-banned] (CWE-120).  Consider using strcat_s, strncat, strlcat, or snprintf (warning: strncat is easily misused). Risk is low because the source is a constant string.
inbound.c:30:  [2] (buffer) strcat:Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination [MS-banned] (CWE-120).  Consider using strcat_s, strncat, strlcat, or snprintf (warning: strncat is easily misused). Risk is low because the source is a constant string.
inbound.c:35:  [2] (buffer) strcat:Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination [MS-banned] (CWE-120).  Consider using strcat_s, strncat, strlcat, or snprintf (warning: strncat is easily misused). Risk is low because the source is a constant string.
inbound.c:40:  [2] (buffer) strcat:Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination [MS-banned] (CWE-120).  Consider using strcat_s, strncat, strlcat, or snprintf (warning: strncat is easily misused). Risk is low because the source is a constant string.
inbound.c:45:  [2] (buffer) strcat:Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination [MS-banned] (CWE-120).  Consider using strcat_s, strncat, strlcat, or snprintf (warning: strncat is easily misused). Risk is low because the source is a constant string.
inbound.c:50:  [2] (buffer) strcat:Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination [MS-banned] (CWE-120).  Consider using strcat_s, strncat, strlcat, or snprintf (warning: strncat is easily misused). Risk is low because the source is a constant string.
inbound.c:59:  [2] (buffer) strcat:Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination [MS-banned] (CWE-120).  Consider using strcat_s, strncat, strlcat, or snprintf (warning: strncat is easily misused). Risk is low because the source is a constant string.
inbound.c:64:  [2] (buffer) strcat:Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination [MS-banned] (CWE-120).  Consider using strcat_s, strncat, strlcat, or snprintf (warning: strncat is easily misused). Risk is low because the source is a constant string.
inbound.c:70:  [2] (buffer) strcat:Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination [MS-banned] (CWE-120).  Consider using strcat_s, strncat, strlcat, or snprintf (warning: strncat is easily misused). Risk is low because the source is a constant string.
inbound.c:79:  [2] (buffer) strcat:Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination [MS-banned] (CWE-120).  Consider using strcat_s, strncat, strlcat, or snprintf (warning: strncat is easily misused). Risk is low because the source is a constant string.
inbound.c:76:  [1] (buffer) strlen:Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).  
Minimum risk level = 1
