flatpak-run.c:52:  [4] (format) syslog:If syslog's format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited (CWE-134).  Use a constant format string for syslog. 
flatpak-run.c:82:  [3] (misc) chroot:chroot can be very helpful, but is hard to use correctly (CWE-250, CWE-22).  Make sure the program immediately chdir("/"), closes file descriptors, and drops root privileges, and that all necessary files (and no more!) are in the new root.
