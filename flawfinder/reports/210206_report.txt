gopher.cc:85:  [2] (buffer) memcpy:Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).  Make sure destination can always hold the source data. 
gopher.cc:91:  [2] (buffer) memcpy:Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).  Make sure destination can always hold the source data. 
gopher.cc:92:  [2] (buffer) memcpy:Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).  Make sure destination can always hold the source data. 
gopher.cc:96:  [2] (buffer) memcpy:Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).  Make sure destination can always hold the source data. 
gopher.cc:271:  [2] (integer) atoi:Unless checked, the resulting number can exceed the expected range (CWE-190).  If source untrusted, check both minimum and maximum, even if the input had no minus sign (large numbers can roll over into negative number; consider saving to an unsigned value if that is intended). 
gopher.cc:273:  [2] (integer) atoi:Unless checked, the resulting number can exceed the expected range (CWE-190).  If source untrusted, check both minimum and maximum, even if the input had no minus sign (large numbers can roll over into negative number; consider saving to an unsigned value if that is intended). 
gopher.cc:297:  [2] (integer) atoi:Unless checked, the resulting number can exceed the expected range (CWE-190).  If source untrusted, check both minimum and maximum, even if the input had no minus sign (large numbers can roll over into negative number; consider saving to an unsigned value if that is intended). 
gopher.cc:222:  [1] (buffer) strlen:Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).
