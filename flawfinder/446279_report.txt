index.c:26:  [2] (buffer) char:Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120).  Perform bounds checking, use functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the maximum possible length. 
index.c:137:  [2] (buffer) memcpy:Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).  Make sure destination can always hold the source data. 
index.c:42:  [1] (buffer) strncpy:Easily used incorrectly; doesn't always \0-terminate or check for invalid pointers [MS-banned] (CWE-120).
