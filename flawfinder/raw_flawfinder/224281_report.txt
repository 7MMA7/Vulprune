Examining extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_195309_224281/gopher_fixed.cc

FINAL RESULTS:

gopher.cc:84:  [2] (buffer) memcpy:Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).  Make sure destination can always hold the source data. 
gopher.cc:90:  [2] (buffer) memcpy:Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).  Make sure destination can always hold the source data. 
gopher.cc:91:  [2] (buffer) memcpy:Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).  Make sure destination can always hold the source data. 
gopher.cc:95:  [2] (buffer) memcpy:Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).  Make sure destination can always hold the source data. 
gopher.cc:274:  [2] (integer) atoi:Unless checked, the resulting number can exceed the expected range (CWE-190).  If source untrusted, check both minimum and maximum, even if the input had no minus sign (large numbers can roll over into negative number; consider saving to an unsigned value if that is intended). 
gopher.cc:276:  [2] (integer) atoi:Unless checked, the resulting number can exceed the expected range (CWE-190).  If source untrusted, check both minimum and maximum, even if the input had no minus sign (large numbers can roll over into negative number; consider saving to an unsigned value if that is intended). 
gopher.cc:299:  [2] (integer) atoi:Unless checked, the resulting number can exceed the expected range (CWE-190).  If source untrusted, check both minimum and maximum, even if the input had no minus sign (large numbers can roll over into negative number; consider saving to an unsigned value if that is intended). 
gopher.cc:223:  [1] (buffer) strlen:Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
 flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
