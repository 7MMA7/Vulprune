Examining extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_198695_281247/LoaderS3M_fixed.cpp

FINAL RESULTS:

LoaderS3M.cpp:412:  [2] (buffer) strcpy:Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned] (CWE-120).  Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy easily misused). Risk is low because the source is a constant string.
LoaderS3M.cpp:15:  [1] (buffer) read:Check buffer boundaries if used in a loop including recursive loops (CWE-120, CWE-20).  
LoaderS3M.cpp:50:  [1] (buffer) read:Check buffer boundaries if used in a loop including recursive loops (CWE-120, CWE-20).  
LoaderS3M.cpp:69:  [1] (buffer) read:Check buffer boundaries if used in a loop including recursive loops (CWE-120, CWE-20).  
LoaderS3M.cpp:79:  [1] (buffer) read:Check buffer boundaries if used in a loop including recursive loops (CWE-120, CWE-20).  
LoaderS3M.cpp:143:  [1] (buffer) read:Check buffer boundaries if used in a loop including recursive loops (CWE-120, CWE-20).  
LoaderS3M.cpp:198:  [1] (buffer) read:Check buffer boundaries if used in a loop including recursive loops (CWE-120, CWE-20).  
LoaderS3M.cpp:215:  [1] (buffer) read:Check buffer boundaries if used in a loop including recursive loops (CWE-120, CWE-20).  
LoaderS3M.cpp:237:  [1] (buffer) read:Check buffer boundaries if used in a loop including recursive loops (CWE-120, CWE-20).  
LoaderS3M.cpp:300:  [1] (buffer) read:Check buffer boundaries if used in a loop including recursive loops (CWE-120, CWE-20).

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
 flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
