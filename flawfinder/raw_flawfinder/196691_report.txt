Examining extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_196691_242637/isoffin_read_vuln.c

FINAL RESULTS:

isoffin_read.c:200:  [2] (buffer) memcpy:Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).  Make sure destination can always hold the source data. 
isoffin_read.c:46:  [1] (buffer) read:Check buffer boundaries if used in a loop including recursive loops (CWE-120, CWE-20).  
isoffin_read.c:96:  [1] (buffer) read:Check buffer boundaries if used in a loop including recursive loops (CWE-120, CWE-20).  
isoffin_read.c:138:  [1] (buffer) read:Check buffer boundaries if used in a loop including recursive loops (CWE-120, CWE-20).  
isoffin_read.c:339:  [1] (buffer) read:Check buffer boundaries if used in a loop including recursive loops (CWE-120, CWE-20).

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
 flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
