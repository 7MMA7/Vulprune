Examining extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_196841_246237/pattern_vuln.cpp

FINAL RESULTS:

pattern.cpp:87:  [4] (buffer) sprintf:Does not check for buffer overflows (CWE-120).  Use sprintf_s, snprintf, or vsnprintf. 
pattern.cpp:2:  [2] (buffer) char:Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120).  Perform bounds checking, use functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the maximum possible length. 
pattern.cpp:118:  [2] (buffer) sprintf:Does not check for buffer overflows (CWE-120).  Use sprintf_s, snprintf, or vsnprintf. Risk is low because the source has a constant maximum length.
pattern.cpp:130:  [2] (buffer) sprintf:Does not check for buffer overflows (CWE-120).  Use sprintf_s, snprintf, or vsnprintf. Risk is low because the source has a constant maximum length.
pattern.cpp:155:  [2] (buffer) sprintf:Does not check for buffer overflows (CWE-120).  Use sprintf_s, snprintf, or vsnprintf. Risk is low because the source has a constant maximum length.
pattern.cpp:161:  [2] (buffer) sprintf:Does not check for buffer overflows (CWE-120).  Use sprintf_s, snprintf, or vsnprintf. Risk is low because the source has a constant maximum length.
pattern.cpp:195:  [2] (buffer) sprintf:Does not check for buffer overflows (CWE-120).  Use sprintf_s, snprintf, or vsnprintf. Risk is low because the source has a constant maximum length.
pattern.cpp:198:  [2] (buffer) sprintf:Does not check for buffer overflows (CWE-120).  Use sprintf_s, snprintf, or vsnprintf. Risk is low because the source has a constant maximum length.
pattern.cpp:243:  [2] (buffer) sprintf:Does not check for buffer overflows (CWE-120).  Use sprintf_s, snprintf, or vsnprintf. Risk is low because the source has a constant maximum length.
pattern.cpp:245:  [2] (buffer) sprintf:Does not check for buffer overflows (CWE-120).  Use sprintf_s, snprintf, or vsnprintf. Risk is low because the source has a constant maximum length.

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
 flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
