load_text.c:57:  [4] (buffer) strcpy:Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned] (CWE-120).  Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy easily misused). 
load_text.c:80:  [4] (buffer) strcpy:Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned] (CWE-120).  Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy easily misused). 
load_text.c:5:  [2] (buffer) char:Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120).  Perform bounds checking, use functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the maximum possible length. 
load_text.c:13:  [1] (buffer) strlen:Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).  
Minimum risk level = 1
