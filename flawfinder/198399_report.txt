ftpcmd.c:4:  [2] (buffer) char:Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120).  Perform bounds checking, use functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the maximum possible length. 
ftpcmd.c:15:  [2] (buffer) sprintf:Does not check for buffer overflows (CWE-120).  Use sprintf_s, snprintf, or vsnprintf. Risk is low because the source has a constant maximum length.
Minimum risk level = 1
