io-xbm.c:33:  [4] (buffer) sscanf:The scanf() family's %s operation, without a limit specification, permits buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20).  Specify a limit to %s, or use a different input function. 
io-xbm.c:62:  [4] (buffer) sscanf:The scanf() family's %s operation, without a limit specification, permits buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20).  Specify a limit to %s, or use a different input function. 
io-xbm.c:64:  [4] (buffer) sscanf:The scanf() family's %s operation, without a limit specification, permits buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20).  Specify a limit to %s, or use a different input function. 
io-xbm.c:66:  [4] (buffer) sscanf:The scanf() family's %s operation, without a limit specification, permits buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20).  Specify a limit to %s, or use a different input function. 
io-xbm.c:68:  [4] (buffer) sscanf:The scanf() family's %s operation, without a limit specification, permits buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20).  Specify a limit to %s, or use a different input function. 
io-xbm.c:70:  [4] (buffer) sscanf:The scanf() family's %s operation, without a limit specification, permits buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20).  Specify a limit to %s, or use a different input function. 
io-xbm.c:9:  [2] (buffer) char:Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120).  Perform bounds checking, use functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the maximum possible length. 
io-xbm.c:11:  [2] (buffer) char:Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120).  Perform bounds checking, use functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the maximum possible length. 
io-xbm.c:31:  [1] (buffer) strlen:Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).  
Minimum risk level = 1
