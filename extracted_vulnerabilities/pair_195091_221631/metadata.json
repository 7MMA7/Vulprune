    "commit_message": "Avoid Segfault for scalar shapes.\n\nCalling tensor::FromElementsOp with an empty vector of elements and no type\ncauses a segfault. We need to let the FromElementsOp know which scalar type it\nshould have.\nAlso add back the DynamicBroadcastInDimOp canonicalization patterns, which\npreviously prevented this bug from happening.\nAdd a regression test that demonstrates the bug.\n\nPiperOrigin-RevId: 417561444\nChange-Id: I6d1d6cfb71aabbad6102422625a00bbe253ac95a",

    "cve_desc": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The `simplifyBroadcast` function in the MLIR-TFRT infrastructure in TensorFlow is vulnerable to a segfault (hence, denial of service), if called with scalar shapes. If all shapes are scalar, then `maxRank` is 0, so we build an empty `SmallVector`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. This is the only affected version.",
