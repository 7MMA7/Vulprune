Examining extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_197973_267357/exec_fixed.c

FINAL RESULTS:

extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_197973_267357/exec_fixed.c:28:  [3] (buffer) getenv:Environment variables are untrustable input if they can be set by an attacker.  They can have any content and length, and the same variable can be set more than once (CWE-807, CWE-20).  Check environment variables carefully before using them.

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.
