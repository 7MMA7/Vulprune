Previous calculation would result in a size that was too large,\nand could underflow to max uint32_t. Also fix 'rsearch' to return the\ncorrect 'pre' string with empty string match.\n\nA future change may 'undefine' this undocumented, non-standard operator\nduring initialization as we do with the many other non-standard internal\nPostScript operators and procedures.",
