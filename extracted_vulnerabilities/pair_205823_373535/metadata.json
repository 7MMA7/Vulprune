    "commit_message": "ipf: release unhandled packets from the batch\n\nSince 640d4db788ed (\"ipf: Fix a use-after-free error, ...\") the ipf\nframework unconditionally allocates a new dp_packet to track\nindividual fragments.  This prevents a use-after-free.  However, an\nadditional issue was present - even when the packet buffer is cloned,\nif the ip fragment handling code keeps it, the original buffer is\nleaked during the refill loop.  Even in the original processing code,\nthe hardcoded dnsteal branches would always leak a packet buffer from\nthe refill loop.\n\nThis can be confirmed with valgrind:\n\n==717566== 16,672 (4,480 direct, 12,192 indirect) bytes in 8 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 390 of 390\n==717566==    at 0x484086F: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:380)\n==717566==    by 0x537BFD: xmalloc__ (util.c:137)\n==717566==    by 0x537BFD: xmalloc (util.c:172)\n==717566==    by 0x46DDD4: dp_packet_new (dp-packet.c:153)\n==717566==    by 0x46DDD4: dp_packet_new_with_headroom (dp-packet.c:163)\n==717566==    by 0x550AA6: netdev_linux_batch_rxq_recv_sock.constprop.0 (netdev-linux.c:1262)\n==717566==    by 0x5512AF: netdev_linux_rxq_recv (netdev-linux.c:1511)\n==717566==    by 0x4AB7E0: netdev_rxq_recv (netdev.c:727)\n==717566==    by 0x47F00D: dp_netdev_process_rxq_port (dpif-netdev.c:4699)\n==717566==    by 0x47FD13: dpif_netdev_run (dpif-netdev.c:5957)\n==717566==    by 0x4331D2: type_run (ofproto-dpif.c:370)\n==717566==    by 0x41DFD8: ofproto_type_run (ofproto.c:1768)\n==717566==    by 0x40A7FB: bridge_run__ (bridge.c:3245)\n==717566==    by 0x411269: bridge_run (bridge.c:3310)\n==717566==    by 0x406E6C: main (ovs-vswitchd.c:127)\n\nThe fix is to delete the original packet when it isn't able to be\nreinserted into the packet batch.
