Examining extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_199767_292205/inbound_fixed.c

FINAL RESULTS:

extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_199767_292205/inbound_fixed.c:4:  [2] (buffer) char:Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120).  Perform bounds checking, use functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the maximum possible length. 
extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_199767_292205/inbound_fixed.c:15:  [2] (buffer) strcpy:Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned] (CWE-120).  Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy easily misused). Risk is low because the source is a constant string.
extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_199767_292205/inbound_fixed.c:24:  [1] (buffer) strlen:Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
