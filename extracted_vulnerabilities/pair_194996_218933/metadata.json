We test that the key exists in the first map but then we don't have any validation that this also means the second map has the needed key. In the scenarios where this is not the case, we'll dereference a nullptr, if we don't have this check\n\nPiperOrigin-RevId: 408739325\nChange-Id: If9bb7ed759aba1f3b56a34913f209508dbaf65ce",

    "cve_desc": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `GetInitOp` is vulnerable to a crash caused by dereferencing a null pointer. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
