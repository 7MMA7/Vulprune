FINAL RESULTS:

extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_195220_222666/tmate-main_vuln.c:60:  [5] (race) chmod:This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a race condition results. (CWE-362).  Use fchmod( ) instead. 
extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_195220_222666/tmate-main_vuln.c:61:  [5] (race) chmod:This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a race condition results. (CWE-362).  Use fchmod( ) instead.

extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_195220_222666/tmate-main_vuln.c:5:  [3] (buffer) getopt:Some older implementations do not protect against internal buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20).  Check implementation on installation, or limit the size of all string inputs. 
extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_195220_222666/tmate-main_vuln.c:17:  [2] (integer) atoi:Unless checked, the resulting number can exceed the expected range (CWE-190).  If source untrusted, check both minimum and maximum, even if the input had no minus sign (large numbers can roll over into negative number; consider saving to an unsigned value if that is intended).

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
