Examining extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_211126_446279/index_vuln.c

FINAL RESULTS:

extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_211126_446279/index_vuln.c:26:  [2] (buffer) char:Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120).  Perform bounds checking, use functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the maximum possible length. 
extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_211126_446279/index_vuln.c:133:  [2] (buffer) memcpy:Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).  Make sure destination can always hold the source data. 
extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_211126_446279/index_vuln.c:38:  [1] (buffer) strncpy:Easily used incorrectly; doesn't always \0-terminate or check for invalid pointers [MS-banned] (CWE-120).

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.
