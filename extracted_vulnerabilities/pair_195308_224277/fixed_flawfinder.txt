Examining extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_195308_224277/flatpak-run_fixed.c

FINAL RESULTS:

extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_195308_224277/flatpak-run_fixed.c:52:  [4] (format) syslog:If syslog's format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited (CWE-134).  Use a constant format string for syslog. 
extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_195308_224277/flatpak-run_fixed.c:82:  [3] (misc) chroot:chroot can be very helpful, but is hard to use correctly (CWE-250, CWE-22).  Make sure the program immediately chdir("/"), closes file descriptors, and drops root privileges, and that all necessary files (and no more!) are in the new root.

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.
