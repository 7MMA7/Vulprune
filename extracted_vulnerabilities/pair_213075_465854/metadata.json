    "commit_message": "nfc: nfcmrvl: main: reorder destructive operations in nfcmrvl_nci_unregister_dev to avoid bugs\n\nThere are destructive operations such as nfcmrvl_fw_dnld_abort and\ngpio_free in nfcmrvl_nci_unregister_dev. The resources such as firmware,\ngpio and so on could be destructed while the upper layer functions such as\nnfcmrvl_fw_dnld_start and nfcmrvl_nci_recv_frame is executing, which leads\nto double-free, use-after-free and null-ptr-deref bugs.\n\nThere are three situations that could lead to double-free bugs.\n\nThe first situation is shown below:\n\n   (Thread 1)                 |      (Thread 2)\nnfcmrvl_fw_dnld_start         |\n ...                          |  nfcmrvl_nci_unregister_dev\n release_firmware()           |   nfcmrvl_fw_dnld_abort\n  kfree(fw) //(1)             |    fw_dnld_over\n                              |     release_firmware\n  ...                         |      kfree(fw) //(2)\n                              |     ...\n\nThe second situation is shown below:\n\n   (Thread 1)                 |      (Thread 2)\nnfcmrvl_fw_dnld_start         |\n ...                          |\n mod_timer                    |\n (wait a time)                |\n fw_dnld_timeout              |  nfcmrvl_nci_unregister_dev\n   fw_dnld_over               |   nfcmrvl_fw_dnld_abort\n    release_firmware          |    fw_dnld_over\n     kfree(fw) //(1)          |     release_firmware\n     ...                      |      kfree(fw) //(2)\n\nThe third situation is shown below:\n\n       (Thread 1)               |       (Thread 2)\nnfcmrvl_nci_recv_frame          |\n if(..->fw_download_in_progress)|\n  nfcmrvl_fw_dnld_recv_frame    |\n   queue_work                   |\n                                |\nfw_dnld_rx_work                 | nfcmrvl_nci_unregister_dev\n fw_dnld_over                   |  nfcmrvl_fw_dnld_abort\n  release_firmware              |   fw_dnld_over\n   kfree(fw) //(1)              |    release_firmware\n                                |     kfree(fw) //(2)\n\nThe firmware struct is deallocated in position (1) and deallocated\nin position (2) again.\n\nThe crash trace triggered by POC is like below:\n\nBUG: KASAN: double-free or invalid-free in fw_dnld_over\nCall Trace:\n  kfree\n  fw_dnld_over\n  nfcmrvl_nci_unregister_dev\n  nci_uart_tty_close\n  tty_ldisc_kill\n  tty_ldisc_hangup\n  __tty_hangup.part.0\n  tty_release\n  ...\n\nWhat's more, there are also use-after-free and null-ptr-deref bugs\nin nfcmrvl_fw_dnld_start. If we deallocate firmware struct, gpio or\nset null to the members of priv->fw_dnld in nfcmrvl_nci_unregister_dev,\nthen, we dereference firmware, gpio or the members of priv->fw_dnld in\nnfcmrvl_fw_dnld_start, the UAF or NPD bugs will happen.\n\nThis patch reorders destructive operations after nci_unregister_device\nin order to synchronize between cleanup routine and firmware download\nroutine.\n\nThe nci_unregister_device is well synchronized. If the device is\ndetaching, the firmware download routine will goto error. If firmware\ndownload routine is executing, nci_unregister_device will wait until\nfirmware download routine is finished.\n\nFixes: 3194c6870158 (\"NFC: nfcmrvl: add firmware download support\")\nSigned-off-by: Duoming Zhou <duoming@zju.edu.cn>\nSigned-off-by: David S.
