Examining extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_210420_434902/gxht_thresh_vuln.c

FINAL RESULTS:

extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_210420_434902/gxht_thresh_vuln.c:9:  [2] (buffer) memcpy:Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).  Make sure destination can always hold the source data. 
extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_210420_434902/gxht_thresh_vuln.c:13:  [2] (buffer) memcpy:Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).  Make sure destination can always hold the source data. 
extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_210420_434902/gxht_thresh_vuln.c:17:  [2] (buffer) memcpy:Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).  Make sure destination can always hold the source data.

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
