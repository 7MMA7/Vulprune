Examining extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_208522_412117/dnscrypt_fixed.c

FINAL RESULTS:

extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_208522_412117/dnscrypt_fixed.c:29:  [2] (buffer) memcpy:Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).  Make sure destination can always hold the source data. 
extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_208522_412117/dnscrypt_fixed.c:40:  [1] (buffer) strlen:Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).  
extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_208522_412117/dnscrypt_fixed.c:45:  [1] (buffer) strlen:Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).  
extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_208522_412117/dnscrypt_fixed.c:46:  [1] (buffer) strlen:Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
