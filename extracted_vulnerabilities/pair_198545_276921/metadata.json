    "commit_message": "i2c: fix stack buffer overflow vulnerability in i2c md command\n\nWhen running \"i2c md 0 0 80000100\", the function do_i2c_md parses the\nlength into an unsigned int variable named length. The value is then\nmoved to a signed variable:\n\n    int nbytes = length;\n    #define DISP_LINE_LEN 16\n    int linebytes = (nbytes > DISP_LINE_LEN) ? DISP_LINE_LEN : nbytes;\n    ret = dm_i2c_read(dev, addr, linebuf, linebytes);\n\nOn systems where integers are 32 bits wide, 0x80000100 is a negative\nvalue to \"nbytes > DISP_LINE_LEN\" is false and linebytes gets assigned\n0x80000100 instead of 16.\n\nThe consequence is that the function which reads from the i2c device\n(dm_i2c_read or i2c_read) is called with a 16-byte stack buffer to fill\nbut with a size parameter which is too large. In some cases, this could\ntrigger a crash. But with some i2c drivers, such as drivers/i2c/nx_i2c.c\n(used with \"nexell,s5pxx18-i2c\" bus), the size is actually truncated to\na 16-bit integer. This is because function i2c_transfer expects an\nunsigned short length. In such a case, an attacker who can control the\nresponse of an i2c device can overwrite the return address of a function\nand execute arbitrary code through Return-Oriented Programming.\n\nFix this issue by using unsigned integers types in do_i2c_md. While at\nit, make also alen unsigned, as signed sizes can cause vulnerabilities\nwhen people forgot to check that they can be negative.\n\nSigned-off-by: Nicolas Iooss <nicolas.iooss+uboot@ledger.fr>\nReviewed-by: Heiko Schocher <hs@denx.de>",
