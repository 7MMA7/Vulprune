Examining extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_211473_448584/io-xbm_vuln.c

FINAL RESULTS:

extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_211473_448584/io-xbm_vuln.c:33:  [4] (buffer) sscanf:The scanf() family's %s operation, without a limit specification, permits buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20).  Specify a limit to %s, or use a different input function. 
extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_211473_448584/io-xbm_vuln.c:56:  [4] (buffer) sscanf:The scanf() family's %s operation, without a limit specification, permits buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20).  Specify a limit to %s, or use a different input function. 
extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_211473_448584/io-xbm_vuln.c:58:  [4] (buffer) sscanf:The scanf() family's %s operation, without a limit specification, permits buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20).  Specify a limit to %s, or use a different input function. 
extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_211473_448584/io-xbm_vuln.c:60:  [4] (buffer) sscanf:The scanf() family's %s operation, without a limit specification, permits buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20).  Specify a limit to %s, or use a different input function. 
extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_211473_448584/io-xbm_vuln.c:62:  [4] (buffer) sscanf:The scanf() family's %s operation, without a limit specification, permits buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20).  Specify a limit to %s, or use a different input function. 
extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_211473_448584/io-xbm_vuln.c:64:  [4] (buffer) sscanf:The scanf() family's %s operation, without a limit specification, permits buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20).  Specify a limit to %s, or use a different input function. 
extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_211473_448584/io-xbm_vuln.c:9:  [2] (buffer) char:Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120).  Perform bounds checking, use functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the maximum possible length. 
extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_211473_448584/io-xbm_vuln.c:11:  [2] (buffer) char:Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120).  Perform bounds checking, use functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the maximum possible length. 
extracted_vulnerabilities/pair_211473_448584/io-xbm_vuln.c:31:  [1] (buffer) strlen:Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
