    "commit_message": "Fixed recursive async function calls.\n\nPreviously, PromiseCapability record was stored (function->context)\ndirectly in function object during a function invocation.  This is\nnot correct, because PromiseCapability record should be linked to\ncurrent execution context.  As a result, function->context is\noverwritten with consecutive recursive calls which results in\nuse-after-free.\n\nThis closes #451 issue on Github.",
